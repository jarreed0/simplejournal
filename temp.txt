   <desc>Got up for church and went with Tyler and Michael (Kyle was running late, he showed up towards the end of sacrement). JD gave a talk about climbing mountains in Seattle and how we can accomplish any goal in life. I didn't learn much in my DC class. JD taught our Priest Quorm Class; we learned about being an ensign unto the world. Then I rested and watched Archer. I then went over to Katie's with Jordan. Jordan, Ashlynn, Maddie and I watched the last episode of Season Four of Sherlock. It was super good! I hope their is another season. Afterwards Haylee came in and we played Uno (I can't remember what it's called exactly, it's more complex then normal Uno). We played about 8 times and I won 3 of them, so I got to write my name on those cards. We noticed after one game that we were passed curfew so Jordan and I left. I stayed up texting Jessica and watching Archer because I didn't have school the next day: yeah! MLK!</desc>

   <desc>Today was MLK day! (I think it may be called Civil Rights day in Idaho actually) and we didnt have school! Which is awesome because I am tired of waking up for my 7:45 calc class so I got up late... as in at 10! From there I did a bunch of homework. I've done most of the HW done already so I went ahead and printed out 70 pages worth of all of this semesters science hw and did about 6 assignments which is great. As I did that I blaired rap music, I dont know how my roommates feel about that. I talked to the person I am in charge of FHE with and we "planned" the activity. Michael cooked us some pizza that was garlic-parm and saussage, I'd never had it before but it was actually really good. I then created, or began the creation of this Journaling software based on a logger that I had created for CS 124 to keep track of my hours I worked on an assignment (but I tested out of the class and didn't make the program that great). It is much better now and saves to an XML doc and can be viewed online, but the entries are on the terminal. I thought to do it because after looking at some project ideas from my dad, I googled on and found my dads journal online (which I should probably tell him is visible to the public haha). I actually read all of the parts that talked about me, it was really cool. My dad gave me some projects to do and I am planning on working on some sorta DNS project, though I am not exactly sure were to begin or what it entails. At seven we went to the FHE activity. There are three apartments in our FHE but we didn't know the third one for awhile so when we invited them they didn't end up coming for wone reason or another. We then played some cards games: one called Cover Your A$$ets where you have to collect assets of different worths and then stop others from taking them. I lost the first game but won the second one! by 560k compared to the 160k in second place. After that we played a game called The Pit where you have to trade cards to collect all of the same cards. We played a few rounds and I won the last on which was cool. Oh and I don't remember all of their names, but one is Maggie (she's incharge with me), another is Sam (she's Tyler's sister which is cool and random), I can't remember the other two names which is sad. After the games we played two truths and a lie (everyone was suprised that my cat had been attacked and lost a leg). After that we watched some random youtube videos, mainly Studio C. Then we went through a 3 page list! of movies they were plannning on watching and wanted us to chip in so we could watch some movies together. There was a ton! so I thought it may get out of hand but they said that when they watch movies they do stuff for it, like eat special food, so I'm actually pretty excited about that. I had them add The Black Cauldron, I can't remember if it's actually good but I remember loving it as a kid so I'm excited for that and all of the other great movies on the list, though I haven't heard of most of them. Then we watched some more youtube videos and then headed out. And that brings me to know: 11:04PM. I'm probably gonna get something to eat, snap Jeff, text Jessica, and watch a show. Though I don't wanna stay up super late like last night because I have classes in the morning (WHICH I NEED TO CHECK MY SCHEDUALE FOR JUST TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING I HAVE). I'm pretty sure I have science which I am happy about because I want to talk to Haylee and I am just be crazy and telling myself this, but I feel like we are growing apart and I don't like that...</desc>
   <todo>Work more on this journal program. Talk to Haylee. Plan another FHE get together. Start on a project for dad. Get some more HW done. Read out of my books.</todo>

   <desc>Got up at like 6:30 but I didn't wanna go to Calc and it was just a review day for the test so I went back to bed. Then I got up later and went to Discrete Math. Classes were boring as usual.. I dropped out of Intro to Finance and Auto 100 because not only was I taking 20 credits, they were super boring and I didn't need them. Then I worked on my Journal program alot more, for some reason the PHP isn't configured with Apache so it's not working exactly right. Then I started working on a program for Dad called Open Campsite. It is a website were people can update info on the availibiltiy, etc., of campsites and parks. Then I started researching some stuff for a DNS Monitor that I'm gonna make for my Dad. Then I went to the Society of A.I. Club. We are gonna start working on an RC car that can drive from different points in the STC building; the project is called Headless Horsemen. Then I went home and worked some more. I didn't have Science like I had thought, but Jordan wanted to do some science stuff. So Jordan, Haylee and I worked on HW, and when I say we worked I mean they did because I'd already done all of my homework. I convinced, or atleast hope I did, Haylee that she needs to get ahead on her homework like Jordan and I and she said we could do that tomorrow, I hope we do. Then I went back and stayed up a little talking to Jessica, we didn't talk much because I was to tired and went to sleep. She told me that she was thinking about going to cosmetology school.. I'm glad for her because that's what she is interested in but then I may never see her again... Welp that was my day. Oh I also didn't go to devo, which neither Jordan nor Haylee were happy about, maybe I'll go next time.</desc>

   <desc>Went to math.. boring. We officially started calculus stuff (limits), it wasn't to bad. Jordan told me it would be insain. Then I went home because tech communication was cancelled so we could work on our resume and I got to say I did mine and it was actually really good, I was suprised, about everything I got onto it. Though the truth is alot of it was just small projects I've worked on and even though some of them are actually big, they aren't public or popular in the slightest. But even then I thought it was cool. I went to science. That was well.. sceince. I sat with Jordan ad Haylee, as usual. We did our in class quiz and I got 100+, though I missed a question but got enough extra credit to still get over 100 so I'm happy about that. As of this moment, other then possibly discrete math because I just don't even know, I think I have a 100 in all my classes. I then went to my new testament class. I slept through alot of it, I guess I finally snapped from staying up late all week. Afterwards I went to my Linux CIT class. I needed to set up a virtual machine, but it just wouldn't work, but I run linux anyways so I should be good. Atleast that's what I tell myself to feel better. My Dad couldn't figure out either. I don't think I worked much more on any of my Dad's projects, just thought about them. I thought my math test closed today so I was afraid I'd have to take it, but then I realized it closes tomorrow. So I spent a some what decent amount of time studying for that and I can honestly say I don't think I am super prepared, just prepared enough. I've been sitting on my laptop for most of the day but I just can't remember what I've been doing... Tyler made some tie noodle pasta that he shared with me it was good. But I ended up getting hungry later and had canned chili mac with raw ramon :). I was telling Haylee both last night and after science that she needs to get ahead in her classes like me and it'd really help and relieve any unneccesary stress and what not. She told me we could work on that today.. but once again a let down. I don't know.. I don't know what I don't know to be honest. Talked to Jeff for a little bit, mainly about my roommates (who have a smash bro tournament coming up), my raw ramon and chili mac, and why wrestling is gay (he disagreed). At the moment I'm talking to Jessica. I'm gonna try and stay up and talk to her more tonight, though I know my body will regret it in the morning. Oh! I remember some stuff I've been doing. I watched alot of youtube and some Game of Thrones (because my HBO trail is ending soon, though there is no way I'll finish it in time). That is about all I think. Goodnight!</desc>
   <todo>Just do some more HW to just get ahead. Work some more on a project for Dad. Double check with Haylee about dinner friday... god sake.. please.</todo>

   <desc>Today I woke up late and had to leave almost immediatly, if I'd woke up any later I would've got to math late. Math still hasn't got hard like Jordan was telling me, hopefully it stays that way. In technical communications we had to bring our resumes we made. I shared mine with three people. Two of them came back to me and told me they're jealous of my projects and wished they'd worked on projects like and said they wanted to do something with me sometime. Then I went to discrete mathmatics next. It was weird as usual. Though he asked a problem that we have to think about till next class: a man has to take a A and B pill each day to live, and if he messes up he will die, but they are not labelled and he mixes 2 B pills with an A pill, what should he do? I don't know yet and can't imagine anything other then guessing. I guess I'll just find out next class. And that was the rest of my school day. Through out the day a guy from our quorm, Josh, kept coming by to give my roommates their home teaching routes. I still haven't gotten one yet though, I don't care to much so that's alright. I went and took my calc test around 3, it went pretty well I think. I didn't work on any projects for my Dad, but I worked on a C++ program to read in files, I want to make an alogrithim program to generate essays, articles, etc. I also did a "bunch" of research on video essays because I want to do that. I created a pretty cool thumbnail for a future video that I like. I've also watched a bunch of Game of Thrones and youtube. Last night Jessica and I didn't talk much, but she agreed that we can watch the Princesses Bride at some point, it's her favorite movie. And she hasn't replied to me yet today so I don't know if we'll take. I think it's to late to talk to Jeff now (he goes to bed at 10:30 to prepare for his mission), so I guess I'll just stay up a bit watching TV and then goto bed so I can finish of this week of school; yay!</desc>
   <todo>Oh I forgot, but I still haven't talked to Haylee. I'll try tonight and if not then I don't know, there is always science class but maybe not. Work more  on my video essay.</todo>

   <desc>Today I woke up at 6:45 as usual.. but then I turned of my alarm and went to bed. I woke up again at 10:30 to see a text from Jordan asking if I was coming to science. I don't really regret it though. I got to go to my CIT class so that's good. I almost completley forgot but there is free donuts on Friday's. Jordan stopped by and we got a bunch, it was great! Then I sat around for alot of the day just working on stuff, mainly my video essay. I did alot more research on making them and got a bunch of clips for my own. I'm gonna try and finish it in the next couple of days. I've also watched alot more of Game of Thrones. Talked to Jeff for awhile, he had a couple of job interviews which is good. Then Ashlynn got ahold of me and said there was an "EMERGENCY". So of course I called back... Maddie's phone wasn't working. They finally decided to talk to me and it's to help them with a stupid problem, I'm starting to hate them more and more. And also of course Haylee never replied about dinner, I'm glad she wasn't there when I came it would of been akward. Well that is about all of my day. I'm making some pasta right now and watching my show.</desc>

   <desc>I slept in till about to 9:30 today. It was pretty nice. I then got up and finished off all the homework I had. Some guy came over and gave me my home teaching route. I am partnered with a guy named Cameron, he teaches the mission prep class I used to go to. We are home teaching room 3113 (I think). I'm in charge of the lesson tomorrow. I worked a ton on my video essay. I finished my script for everything and did some artwork for my youtube page. I've also been watching a bunch of Game of Thrones. My HBO subscription is about to end in a few days. I'm not going to finish it in time so I'm not positive on what I am to do. Other then that I didn't really do much.</desc>

   <desc>Went to church again with Tyler and Michael. I don't remember most of the talks. The first girl talked about achieving goals. Maddie gave a talk as well. I sat in the back during the second hour just on my phone the whole time. The third hour went by pretty fast. At home I just did some home work, work more on my video essays, and watched some more Game of Thrones. Jordan came over and we hungout for a little while. Cameron and I went to go hometeaching but the room we went to was just watching some video game broadcast and were to distracted by a lesson, which was fine by me. That was about my day, pretty boring and laid back.</desc>

   <desc>Today I got up and headed out to math just in time. Math was fine I guess and my teacher forgot to hand out the notes on friday so I got them even though I had missed class which is awesome. Tech communications was boring, I just did stuff on my laptop the whole time. From there I just went on with my day. I eventually came home and worked on my computer. I did some homework, did more for my video essay, and then I started an outline for a book that I want to write. My FHE group came over around 7. This time the other dorm came (except they were missing one person), so there was 13 people. We just talked and got to know eachother which was nice. Sadly I don't remember practically anyones names. Later I went to study science with Jordan. I didn't really study much and I distracted him alot. Haylee was supposed to come but of course she didn't. Some girl came by to invite us to a party and give us a "super special offer" (which she definatly gives to everyone). We told her no thanks but then she gave us some super great advice coming from someone also in there second semester: You can always re-take your classes, but you can't relive your parties. Jordan and I though that was hilarrious. We ended hanging out all night. I came home a little bit after midnight and headed to bed.</desc>

   <desc>I woke up late today and missed calculus and by the time I was going to leave for discrete math I was already late so I decided just to stay home. I worked a little more on my video essay. I started to record stuff but never got it down because Jordan came over and we left off to devotional. The guy that spoke was in the quorum of the 70's and was a mechanical engineer. I kinda dozed off at the beginning but towards the end I listened to him tell a story about his first project were we was underwater pipelines from oil pumps. Afterwards I came home and did some more work. I then went to my Society of AI meeting. We kinda just intduced some more stuff today. Then I came home and talked to my roommates about stuff. Then I called Austin and we discussed making a video game. I am going to try and get a bunch of people to help. Then my roommates watched The Grand Tour.</desc>

Hopefully that'll help me understand what the class is all about because I aint got a clue. I got a guy to join the dev team. So far there is 10 of us. I'm really excited. We've got a story down and I talked to Austin alot about it. Jordan and I went to the BYU Managment Society meeting. The owner of Braulims and his son came and spoke to us about running their business and competing with Wal-Mart by being friendly and lowering their prices. It was very interesting stuff.</desc>

   <desc>Today I got to rest in because I didn't have math because of my math test. I woud say it was nice but I've been skipping math practically every day this week. Then I went to science with Haylee. It was cool. We learned about how large the whole universe is. It's so mind blowing. Some people came out of it thinking they were tiny and "worthless". But if anything it only showed me a drive to work hard to become even bigger and greater then I am. I worked some more on my game company. I called Austin and we talked for awhile about plans. Everything is going pretty great. In my Linux class we did an assignment. The guy I sit with (I forgot his name :|) said that everyone uses Windows so the Windows class will be easy. I then told him I've never used it and have always used Linux. He, along with others, were super suprised. It's pretty cool. The assignments have us do a ton of stuff on our computers and write out the output but I already know what it does so I can just answer it immediately. I didn't do much else with my day. Just researched and read about stuff. Oh! actually it was donut day so I got a bunch of donuts with Jordan, which was great of course. And that was my day.</desc>

I told him about the game projet and he's on board. That lasted about four or so hours. I made brownies for the church activity but I never ended up going. There were some brownies left over though which was awesome. At 4is I went down to work on a project for Discrete Math. It helped alot working with others and I can kinda understand the class better. I then went over to the FHE dorm and watched Robin Hood. I hadn't watched it in forever and it was really good. I then came back made food, did homework, watched Family Guy, and worked some more on the game.</desc>

From there the rest of church was, well, just church. Around two the home teachers came over. There names are John and Richard. I actually home teach them and their roommates. They're both computer science majors. They talked about missionary work. Afterwards I went to work more on my game. I just researched alot, played around with Unreal and Blender, and planned out a meeting. That's basically what I ended up doing for the whole day, that and watch Family Guy.</desc>

We had dinner which was great, but then they wanted to play games so some friends and I left. We went to their apartment and watches shows and played card games. It was pretty fun. I scheduled a conference room for my dev team. Overall my day went pretty well.</desc>

   <desc>Once again I wasted away my day with school. It was stupid, but that was expected so I can only blame myself. In calculus we began our unit on derivatives which was fine. In technical communications we did practice interviews. Thank god I didn't have to go... though I have to tomorrow. I just sat around in discrete math on my laptop. I've given up on it so I just don't even... know. The class is just super duper stupid. Dad looked at my text book and thinks my teacher is an idiot. I then went to devotional with Jordan and we sat at the very front so I couldn't see dip. It was great. I don't remember who spoke or what she spoke about, but that doesn't matter. Next week Elder Oaks (an apositle) is coming, maybe I'll go. I went to by Society of AI club. No one showed up for like 20 minutes. Eventually the leader guy showed up and taught us some stuff. I learned more in that that any other class I've taken this semester. Atleast anything that I cared to learn. I called Elisabeth and we talked for like an hour. She is leaving on her mission to South Korea tomorrow morning. Jordan then came over and we've been talking and wasting time once again with pointless homework. That has been my day so far. I assume nothing else will happen. It's ten right now. If anything spectacular happens I'll let you know. Bye sucker. -- UPDATE. Haylee ended up coming over to work on homework with Jordan and I. Looking back at it I kinda feel bad because I was doing something and not paying much attention to her. She later told us she was having problems with her roommates. I don't know much. I'm super happy she came over though. I'm gonna see her again tomorrow in science and I'm gonna see if she wants to study for our science test tomorrow night.</desc>

   <desc>Today went pretty well. I left last minute to math. But I got there in time and learned some new things. In technical communications I had to do a sorta practice interview in front of the whole class. I feel like I didn't do that great, but others seemed to be looking at me as if it was good so I don't really know. I then went to science. That class was fine. Haylee and I walked back afterwards. We planned to study later that night (but guess what.. we didn't because she literally backs out of everything). Religion class was boring, but atleast he didn't teach us any hebrew words today. During my CIT class I started so snap. I hadn't eaten in about 30 hours and couldn't stand it. From there I met up with Jordan and we walked down to his work. I then went and got Taco Bell. Then I went to Cottonwood to work on a group assignment for discrete math. I then came home for a little bit, then I left to my meeting. It started at 7:30. Only Tyler, Michael, and Daniel showed up at first. Austin, Qaleb, and Cody joined in on a google hangouts call. Eventually Jarom showed up, he was taking a test. The meeting overall went pretty well I think, though I know my presentation skills need some imporvement. I, along with everyone else, am really excited about where we are gonna go from here on our game and company. I then came home and discussed some more of the game with my roommates. Then I began to watch Resevoir Dog's. I didn't finish it because I went to bed. I also talked to Jeff for awhile about random stuff. That was my day.</desc>
   <todo>Finish my video. Work on game and make sure others are also. Work on my book research. Study for my science, hopefully with Haylee, and take it.</todo>
